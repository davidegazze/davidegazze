Hi 👋  
I design and build AI systems where data, models, and reality collide.

PhD in Information Engineering.  
Former Research Fellow @ CNR (IIT Pisa).  
Team Leader on production AI projects.

What I work on:
• Data Engineering (Spark, large-scale pipelines)  
• Backend systems & APIs  
• GUIs and end-user tools  
• Machine Learning & Deep Learning at scale  
• NLP, multilingual systems, and LLMs  
• Generative AI & LLMOps  
• Data-heavy, real-world AI (no toy projects)

I’m not interested in hype. I’m interested in systems that survive contact with reality.
